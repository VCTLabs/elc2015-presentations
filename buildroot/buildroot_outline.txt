* buildroot has low learning curve
  * design goal for simplicity
  * 'make' and 'patch' are in developer Lingua Franca
    (parlez vous 'make'?)
  * solid documentation
* buildroot for MMU-less cpus
  * MMU-less support status as of March 2015
    * blackfin - definitely works, vendor supported
    * SH (superh) and xtensa nommu - basic rootfs compiles, probably works?
    * nommu flavor of fpga cpus - know someone successfully using basic rootfs
    * arm nommu - build fails
      * too bad this is most likely what you are most interested in
  * still most likely successor to uclinux-dist
    * extensive uclibc support
      * all packages tested against uclibc
    * at least blackfin works as example

* buildroot basics
  * directory layout
  * high-level workflow

* buildroot customization
  * upstreamable changes vs local changes
    * git branch
    * overlay repo
  * external toolchain
  * configuration
    * toplevel system
      * target selection
      * package selection
      * rootfs format
    * key packages (busybox, kernel, uclibc)
  * skeleton
  * add patches
  * add packages
    * autotools, cmake, python, perl, lua, erlang
    * virtual (jpeg, udev, opengl)
    * generic
  * odds and ends
    * static devices
    * file permissions/ownership
    * extra user accounts
