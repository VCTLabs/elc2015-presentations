New - Cybersecurity Guidance for DoD! - The new cybersecurity overarching guidance for 
DoD has been published.  Included are two new DoD instructions:
DoDI 8500.01, "Cybersecurity," replacing previous information assurance (IA) guidance.
DoDI 8510.01, "Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT)," 
replacing the previous DIACAP guidance with an assessment and authorization (A&A) process. 
Date: Mar 28, 2014

DIACAP
Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process 
(DIACAP) Instruction  This DoD Instruction replaces existing DITSCAP guidance under 
DoDI 5200.40 and DoD 8510.1-M.

Security Requirements Guides (SRGs)
http://iase.disa.mil/srgs/index.html
Security Requirement Guide (SRG) - A compilation of Control Correlation 
Identifiers (CCIs) grouped into more applicable, specific technology areas 
at various levels of technology and product specificity. An SRG provides DoD 
specificity to CCI requirements (organizationally defined parameters). An 
SRG is used by DISA FSO and vendor guide developers to build Security 
Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs). There are basically two types 
of SRGs. The first group are the four CORE SRGs which deal with Applications, 
Networking Devices, Operating Systems, and Policy. The second group are the 
Technology specific SRGs. A Technology specific SRG is a child of a CORE SRG. 
For example, the Database SRG was derived from the requirements in the 
Application SRG.

Control Correlation Identifier (CCI)
http://iase.disa.mil/cci/index.html
The Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) provides a standard identifier and description 
for each of the singular, actionable statements that comprise an IA control or IA best 
practice. CCI bridges the gap between high-level policy expressions and low-level 
technical implementations. CCI allows a security requirement that is expressed in 
a high-level policy framework to be decomposed and explicitly associated with the 
low-level security setting(s) that must be assessed to determine compliance with 
the objectives of that specific security control. This ability to trace security 
requirements from their origin (e.g., regulations, IA frameworks) to their low-level 
implementation allows organizations to readily demonstrate compliance to multiple 
IA compliance frameworks. CCI also provides a means to objectively rollup and 
compare related compliance assessment results across disparate technologies.

A draft version of the CCI List conforming to CCI version 2 is now available. 
This list contains CCIs derived from NIST SP 800-53.

Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)
http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/index.html
The Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) and the NSA Guides are the 
configuration standards for DOD IA and IA-enabled devices/systems. Since 1998, 
DISA Field Security Operations (FSO) has played a critical role enhancing the 
security posture of DoD's security systems by providing the Security Technical 
Implementation Guides (STIGs). The STIGs contain technical guidance to "lock down" 
information systems/software that might otherwise be vulnerable to a malicious 
computer attack.
