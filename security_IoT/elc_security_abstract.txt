Security Architecture in the IOT Age

Once upon a time, most embedded devices were designed for a narrow purpose
and only communicated with other devices within a closed system, if at all.
Modern embedded Linux devices rarely fit that description -- they are normally
networked into a larger system, taking advantage of Linux's strength in
networking. Unfortunately, embedded engineers all too often fail to
spend enough time understanding and mitigating security risks faced by
networked devices; recent CVE summaries for popular Linux home routers provide
some glaring examples of insufficient attention to security.

With the growing trend towards more and more network-centric devices,
it is critical that embedded engineers increase their attention to security  
while developing products, rather than merely reacting to specific exploits
discovered after release. A good starting point is to learn and apply security 
architecture best practices that have been documented over the years by 
system architects/engineers using a modern "system of systems" approach
and the latest NIST standards, guidance, and risk management framework.
